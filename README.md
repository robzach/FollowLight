Originally using Leapmotion data input to drive three stepper motors in threespace on a small scale. That was a prototype.

Now working on using a Kinect to drive the same motors over a much larger spatial range, to make it so a suspended light bulb persistently sits over a participant's head.

Video documentation of the system as installed:
