# The light that follows you around the room.

A user's position is read by a Kinect, and three motors drive a light bulb to always hover about a foot above their head as they move around a space.

(Originally used Leapmotion data input to drive three stepper motors in threespace on a small scale. That was a mini-prototype.)
